Analysis - Ved
Create a Jupyter notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
Use Matplotlib to create 6 to 8 visualizations of your data  (ideally, at least 2 visualizations per “question” that you ask your data).
Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team—and for inclusion in your presentation.
Write-up - Teresita 
Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” that you asked your data as well as a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.
